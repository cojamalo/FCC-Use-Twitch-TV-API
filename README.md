# Use-Twitch-TV-API

Completion Date: Oct 10, 2016

This is the repository for my completion of the freeCodeCamp "Use the Twitchtv JSON API" project. Formatted for mobile use.

A working version is at http://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/bwLkmZ.

The project is an example of an AJAX request to Twitch TV. HTML and CSS are used to style the page. Shows users if a set list of streamers are online and streaming or not. 

Project coded by Connor Lenio - released into the public domain for educational purposes in 2016.
